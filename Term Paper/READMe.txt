FREE GIFT CARDS, IN-GAME CONTENT, ACCESSORIES FOR THE GAMING COMMUNITY 
 
Introduction
------------- 
Most of us believe that gaming is a futile activity among all of the others. But there are a lot of people out there who succeeded in making a fortune in this field. Some of us believe that it is all because of their good setup /accessories or the “PAY TO WIN SYSTEM (i.e., the microtransactions)”, while some believe that it is all because of the player’s ability to thrive and strive while playing the game. Whatever may be the case it all comes down to showing rare achievements and surprisingly God-Tier items in a player’s inventory at the end of the day. Owning these items has only been a dream for many individuals out there because of how pricey these items are on the gaming market.  That is when we got the idea of designing a website that handed out gift cards/content items to all the players. 
 
Abstract
---------
Back in the day, when gaming/streaming was not that big of a deal, there was not a single website that used to offer these services since the gaming industry was not huge then and a lot of people had the opportunity to get the pirated version of the game. Because of this they never had the opportunity to earn achievements and in-game items/content (namely DLC). As the world was moving on and saw rapid growth in the gaming industry a lot of streamers/content creators came into existence. As of now, there are a lot of streamers who inspired many people, and the fact that they usually have a signature in-game item (or) an item based on them. So, people started liking them and received a lot of appreciation. Because of the growth and the popularity of these items and the streamers themselves, many individuals/gamers wanted to own a lot of these items considering the fact how rare and pricey some of the items are. So, some developers came up with the idea of designing a website that offers free in-game items and gaming accessories to just launch their website/application in the background while playing the game. Despite having a few websites providing these services many people were skeptical about how they were making money out of it. Well, some turned out to be legitimate, but the user must have a membership while others turned out to be a gamer's nightmare. It turns out some of the websites/applications the players were using were crypto miners in the name of a gift card website/application. These applications mainly use the “user” Graphics Processing Unit (i.e., GPU)  to mine cryptocurrency while they interactively play the  game, and an average user doesn’t even have an idea about this [3]. Being a victim of these applications we had an idea to make an application that gives gift cards to gamers without any membership and without triggering any suspicious activities on a user’s computer. Our idea was to hand out game content by generating advertisement revenue and partnering with the gaming community [2]. 
 
Backstory of The Idea 
---------------------
It all started when my friends and I started gaming back at a very young age (dated: 2016). At that time, we didn’t have much idea about online gaming and its vast community of people. We were so much into gaming that we used to spend most of our time glued to the chairs and our eyes right on the screen. Slowly but progressively, we used to trade a lot of in-game items for a small amount of profit and after grinding some of the precious moments of our lives we had what we have ever dreamt of. This process takes a lot of research and a lot of effort. In general terms, this is a time-consuming process. This can be achieved by an alternative method by just using your parent’s credit card and no parent in this world wants their children to use their credit card to spend all the money on these games. That’s when we started using an application to give these gift cards but, it turned out to be a rip-off. That’s when we got the idea to make our website/application which gives out gift cards, in-game items, and gaming accessories to all the games out there. We thought of using advertisement revenue, website trafficking, and partnered sponsorships to gain revenue and keep the website/application in an active state. 
 
Technologies we were supposed to use
------------------------------------- 
For the raw structure of the webpage, we thought of using Hyper Text Markup Language (HTML). Initially, we thought of using Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) for styling the webpage But later learned about a front-end framework Bootstrap 3. Using Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) would take a lot of time to place the elements on the webpage and we need to have a better understanding of all the positions, flexbox, grid layouts, media queries, and most importantly Box – Model. So, using a framework would be a bit feasible proving the fact that we can style a container/element by just using pre-defined classes that Bootstrap 3 has to offer at that time. Moving forward, for the functionality of the website we thought of using vanilla Java Script but for similar reasons, we used both (Java Script and React). React offers more flexibility and significantly fewer lines of code to get the same result as JavaScript. However, a great understanding is required to learn and improvise both JavaScript and React. We thought of using RESTful API for the communication of data between the server and the database. Speaking of Database, initially, we thought of using NOSQL but because of its poor interlinking relationships, we used SQL which is great at maintaining relationships. Finally, to host our website we thought of using any free web hosting services like GitHub and later shifting to a paid web hosting service that the market has to offer. 
 
Basic Working of the Application
---------------------------------
Initially, the user is prompted via an alert keyword in JavaScript or induced from React to accept the terms and conditions and the cookie settings for the website and the data sharing, and data storage. (The alert is styled using Bootstrap 3 to beautify the alert container.)  Once the user is on the website they need to register for an account and all their data is stored in the Data Base. This information is even used for targeted advertisements. The next part is linking their gamer tag to the website and all their statistical data is read and stored again in a Data Base. The website comprises two different segments one is the user’s statistical / gaming process, and the second segment is the global market. The market contains all the gift cards, gaming accessories, and In-game items that the user can retrieve. This website uses advertisement revenue, website traffic, and gaming sponsorships to generate revenue. The communication on the website and the game is done using the EVENTBUS pattern. The application would function efficiently because the events work in a proper synergy. 
 
EVENT BUS PATTERN
-----------------
The Event Bus is usually used as a communication mechanism between two or multiple events/modules. We might even think of this as an event management center. The basic process behind this is one module sends a message, and the other module receives the message. So, this achieves the basic functionality of communication. This Event Bus pattern is convenient for building single-page applications. If there are multiple pages, the developer must first think of all the possible routing between the pages to handle the general events (or) actions. In simple terms, an Event Bus can be defined as a global way to deliver / transport messages or events to make them accessible from any place within the application [1]. 
 
Conclusion
----------
So, to wrap this topic up this application will be helpful and engaging in the gaming community. The highlighted topic about this application is that it is very safe to use, and it is computer friendly. Some of the similar applications that are available in the gaming industry do not work what they claim to do. These applications use the user’s Graphic Processing Unit (GPU) to mine cryptocurrency and it decreases the life of the GPU. This turned out to be true in certain scenarios where the application mines crypto in the name of giving the user the items that they dreamt of getting through these applications. If this application stands out and works properly in a loop there is going to be a lot of people who can strive and become outstanding gamer and help out the gaming community and the individuals.
