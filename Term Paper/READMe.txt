As a former esports player, I've experienced the challenges of having a subpar setup and not enough funds to improve it. During my undergraduate days, we came up with the idea of creating this website to assist people in getting the in-game content, microtransactions, and gear they desired. The paper covers the technologies I planned to use for the website, the backstory behind the idea, an introduction, an abstract, details about how the application works, and a conclusion.
