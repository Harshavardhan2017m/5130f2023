# All-in-One Outdoor Activity Website

## Project Concept
Our vision is to craft a streamlined and user-friendly website catering to enthusiasts of the great outdoors. This hub will be the go-to source for comprehensive details on the best beaches, hiking trails, and scenic overlooks.

## Week 2 Progress Report
During the second week, our focus was on the aesthetic development of the Client page through CSS. Simultaneously, the Client page is brought to live in the front end. Backend efforts are underway to establish robust database interactions for managing user data for Client and login pages. This Client page represents the tourism or adventure-themed website, with a focus on tours, events, and exploration. Run `adventure.html` file to see the Client page and its implemented functionalities.

## Client-Page Functionalities
1. A fixed glass-style navbar with a logo and navigation links.
2. Includes Home, Activities, Explore, Tours, About, Contact, and a LogOut button. These likely link to respective sections of the page.
3. JavaScript event listener on the menu button for mobile responsiveness, toggling a class for a mobile menu view.
4. Events section to inform visitors about various upcoming events like "TrekDiscover", "SightScope", and "Beachscape".
5. Tours section for details about upcoming tours and destinations with dates and brief descriptions.
6. Checkbox for switching between light and dark modes, enhancing user experience and accessibility.
7. Responsive CSS for adaptability to different screen sizes.

## Encountered Issues
1. Elements not aligning or resizing correctly on different devices or screen orientations.
2. Images not loading correctly or slow site loading due to large image files. Implemented lazy loading for images.
3. The button does not take the user back to the top of the page. Proper implementation of JavaScript for smooth scrolling.

## Planned Enhancements
1. Refined navigation and integration of the dashboard with login and sign-up modules.
2. Implementation of Google Firebase for efficient storage and retrieval of user credentials and profile information.
3. Aesthetic and functional enhancement of the CSS for login and sign-up interfaces.
4. Development of a dynamic 'Adventure' section encompassing Home, Activities, Explore, Tours, About, and Contact Information.
5. Crafting a responsive UI for an intuitive dashboard experience.
6. Integration of Google Maps, tailored to user-selected locales.

## Achievements/ Accomplishments

2. Developed an events section with a card layout, enhancing accessibility and user-friendliness.
3. Implemented an interactive carousel for dynamic content presentation.
