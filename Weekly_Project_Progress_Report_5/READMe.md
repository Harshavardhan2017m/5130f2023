# All-in-One Outdoor Activity Website

## Project Concept
The Outdoor Activity website is a specially-made website for people who love to travel and explore new places. It's a complete guide that gives detailed information about various travel spots like peaceful beaches, beautiful trails, and interesting places to see. The website is not just about giving information; it's designed to make the user's experience better. It lets travelers set up their accounts or log in to them. This feature makes the experience more personal and customized, helping users plan their travels in a way that fits their likes and interests.

## Week 5 Progress Report
Last week, we finished the basic layout for important website pages like the homepage, login, registration, and pages about specific destinations (beaches, trails, sightseeing). We used Bootstrap to make sure the website looks good and works well on mobile devices. We also set up Firebase on the registration and login pages for secure user sign-up and login. To make the website look nicer, we added attractive images and stylish fonts.

## Login & Registration Pages
1. These pages use Firebase to make sure users can safely sign in. New users can sign up by giving their email and a password on the registration page.
2. The login page lets returning users easily get into their accounts.
3. We can add helpful features like password reset, a 'remember me' option, and ways to log in with social media to make it more convenient.
4. After logging in, users go to their own dashboard where they can see their saved travel favorites and plans.

## Client-Page Functionalities

### Trails Page
1. Tailored for hiking and adventure enthusiasts, this page lists various famous trails and hiking spots.
2. Detailed information on each trail includes difficulty level, distance, estimated completion time, and scenic highlights.
3. Incorporates maps and possibly virtual tours to give users a better understanding of the terrain.
4. Links to essential gear and preparation tips for different trails are provided to assist in planning.

## Encountered Issues
1. There were problems with the geolocation feature. Specifically, issues arose when a user's browser didn't support geolocation, when geolocation itself was not available, and when geocoding was unsuccessful.
2. Problems with the search functionality, specifically when searches were unsuccessful, as indicated by an alert mentioning that the search was not successful for a particular reason.
3. Issues with the website's layout not adjusting properly on some mobile devices, especially when used in landscape orientation.

## Planned Enhancements
1. Adding a feature for users to save their preferred travel spots.
2. Improving how well the app works on mobile devices.
3. Allowing users to rate and review each travel destination.
4. Introducing an interactive map to help with navigation.

## Achievements/ Accomplishments
1. The page is specifically designed for those who love hiking and adventures, featuring a list of well-known trails and hiking locations.
2. It provides comprehensive information about each trail, including how hard it is, how long it is, how long it might take to complete, and its scenic features.
3. The inclusion of maps and possibly virtual tours helps users get a clearer picture of what the trails are like.
