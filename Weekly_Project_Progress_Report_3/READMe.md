# All-in-One Outdoor Activity Website

## Project Concept
We aim to create an effortlessly navigable website that caters to outdoor enthusiasts. This central hub will serve as the ultimate destination for in-depth information on top-notch beaches, hiking trails, and breathtaking scenic viewpoints.

## Week 3 Progress Report
In the third week, we made significant strides in enhancing user experience and functionality:
- Added features for upcoming events in nearby trails, beaches, and sightseeing spots.
- Integrated with Google Maps for location tracking, providing detailed information and navigation assistance.
- Continued backend development for robust database interactions to manage user data on Client and login pages.
- The Client page is developed with a focus on tourism, adventures, tours, and events.

### Client-Page Functionalities
1. A stationary glass-style navigation bar featuring a logo and navigation links.
2. Comprising Home, Activities, Explore, Tours, About, Contact, and a LogOut button, these tabs likely lead to corresponding sections of the page.
3. Employing a JavaScript event listener on the menu button ensures mobile responsiveness, activating a class that transforms the view into a mobile-friendly menu.
4. The Events section is present to update visitors on upcoming events such as "TrekDiscover," "SightScope," and "Beachscape."
5. A Tours section has been integrated to provide details about upcoming tours and destinations, complete with dates and concise descriptions.
6. Enhancing user experience and accessibility, a checkbox is available for seamlessly toggling between light and dark modes.
7. The implementation of CSS files for both the main style and responsive design underscores adaptability to various screen sizes.

### Encountered Issues
1. Challenges in responsive design for different devices and orientations.
2. Optimizing image loading speed and implementing lazy loading.
3. Difficulty in implementing a smooth scroll-to-top functionality.
4. Inconsistencies in Google API data retrieval and mapping accuracy.

## Planned Enhancements
1. Refined navigation and dashboard integration.
2. SQL Lite3 for efficient user data management.
3. Enhanced CSS for the login and sign-up interfaces.
4. Development of a dynamic 'Adventure' section.
5. Responsive UI design for the dashboard.
6. Tailored Google Maps integration based on user location.
